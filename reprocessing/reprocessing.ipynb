    "> Today MOX is widely used in Europe and in Japan. Currently about 40 reactors in Europe (Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and France) are licensed to use MOX, and over 30 are doing so. In Japan about ten reactors are licensed to use it and several do so. These reactors generally use MOX fuel as about one-third of their core, but some will accept up to 50% MOX assemblies. France aims to have all its 900 MWe series of reactors running with at least one-third MOX. Japan also planned to use MOX in one-third of its reactors in the near future and APDC expects to start up a 1383 MWe (gross) reactor with a complete fuel loading of MOX at the Ohma plant in 2022. Other advanced light water reactors such as the EPR or AP1000 are able to accept complete fuel loadings of MOX if required. --- World Nuclear Association\n",
