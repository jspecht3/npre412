    "In the context of world energy, where does nuclear power sit? It's producing about 18-20% of US electricity, but what about world electricity? What about world energy? Where is the world getting its energy, and what parts of the world are consuming what? How do different sources of energy and electricity compete and compare? \n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be equipped to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the major sources of energy consumed worldwide and domestically\n",
    "- Differentiate between energy use and electricity use\n",
    "- Recognize the niche filled by nuclear power\n",
    "- Summarize the history of power from different sectors both worldwide and domestically\n",
    "- Map the geography of nuclear power production\n",
    "- Recognize the names of institutions for energy information and understand the data they collect\n",
