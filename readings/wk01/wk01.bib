	abstract = {It is well known that electrical power generation is the key factor for advances in industry, agriculture, technology, and the standard of living. Also, strong power industry with diverse energy sources is very important for a country's independence. In general, electrical energy can be generated from: (1) nonrenewable energy sources such as coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear; and (2) renewable energy sources such as hydro, biomass, wind, geothermal, solar, and marine power. Today, the main sources for electrical energy generation are: (1) thermal power{\textemdash}primarily using coal and secondarily using natural gas; (2) {\textquotedblleft}large{\textquotedblright} hydroelectric power plants; and (3) nuclear power. The balance of the energy sources is from using oil, biomass, wind, geothermal and solar, and has visible impact just in a few countries. This chapter presents the current status of electricity generation in the world, various sources of industrial electricity generation, role of nuclear power with a comparison of nuclear energy systems to other energy systems.},
